### Tutorial 1

This tutorial introduces basic functionality of R package [anRichment](https://github.com/plangfelder/anRichment). 
It illustrates usage for enrichment calculations of novel gene sets in existing reference gene sets, 
creation of new gene sets, 
and export and import of multiple gene sets at once. The example analysis is carried out using modules 
identified by Oldham et al (2008).

To run the tutorial code, please create a separate folder for the tutorial, downlodad the data necessary for the tutorial
linked below and unpack (unzip) it in the folder. The unpacking should producde a subfolder named Data and in it file
named MO_FxOrg_ColorVectors.csv.bz2.

 - [zipped data](Tutorial1-EnrichmentOfOldhamModules/Tutorial1-EnrichmentOfOldhamModules-Data.zip) 

The tutorial text and code are contained in this PDF document

 - [Tutorial 1](Tutorial1-EnrichmentOfOldhamModules/anRichment-Tutorial1-EnrichmentOfOldhamModules.pdf)

For users who would like to adapt the code to their data and analyses, we also provide an R script that contains the code
in from Tutorial 1 in a plain text R code file that should be easier to modify and/or include in other R scripts:
